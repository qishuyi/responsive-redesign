          Hi there! This is Shuyi with my studies in interaction design. I am doing a webpage responsive redesign project 
          for an Interaction Design class at Brown University. This project aims at redesigning <a href="https://city-kitty.com/">the home page of the website of City Kitty</a>, 
          which is a local vet in Providence providing healthcare for cats. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose this website because I plan to take my cat to City Kitty for a vet visit. I noticed some design deficiencies in its home page, such as the buttons did not present themselves 
          as clickable, making it hard for users to learn the interface.
        </p> 
        <p>
          In this design project I will incorporate my understanding of interaction design and 
          present my ideas about how to redesign the webpage to make it more learnable, efficient, memorable and hopefully accessible. I will also create a webpage in HTML/CSS 
          and incorporate the concept of responsive design into it. This HTML/CSS page will be nicely formatted on screens of various sizes, ranging from a laptop to a tablet, 
          and also a smartphone.
        </p> 
        <p>
          Below is a screenshot of the webpage before my redesign.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Finding Problems</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        I noticed a few problems with respect to this webpage's efficiency, learnability and memorability. These 
        are potential problems that make the webpage hard to use for the general users. I also have some ideas about how to 
        improve this webpage in these three categories and will list them below:
        <h4 class="subTitle">Efficiency:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Currently the buttons are positioned vertically as directions in a street sign. Because users usually read from left to right and then top to bottom, I 
            think laying out the clickable buttons horizontally at the top will be more efficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition, the text on the buttons are not written 100% horizontally, but instead 
            with some angles, which makes it harder for the users to read and thus less efficient. I suggest making them 
            all horizontal and parallel.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="subTitle">Learnability:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The design of making all the clickable buttons into street signs also makes the buttons hard to learn 
            because it makes the buttons look like they are only for decorative purpose, which makes it 
            harder to learn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Moreover, the title "City Kitty" has the same design as the buttons but the title 
            is not clickable, which also makes the interface hard to learn because the users tend to think that all elements of the same 
            design are either all clickable or all unclickable.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <div>
        <h4 class="subTitle">Memorability:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All the clickable items are laid out with the same design without clear hierarchies, 
            which makes it harder to memorize for the users. I think making some more frequently used buttons stand out more 
            would be a better idea. For a redesign, I would place some buttons 
            on the top right corner and the others below the title, with some in bold text and some not, to make it more memorable.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        Besides efficiency, memorability and learnability, I also ran the webpage through WebAIM WAVE to test its accessibillity. 
        The page performs relatively well in this criteria but some problems are still identified.
        <h4 class="subTitle">Accessibility:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The WebAIM WAVE indicates color contrast errors in the webpage, along with 
            several alerts, including "Redundant alternative text", "Orphaned form label", 
            "Skipped heading level", "Suspicious link text", "Noscript element" and "Tabindex". 
          </li>
          <li>
            The skipped heading level aligns with my findings about the mixed and unclear hierarchies in the text. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I think the suspicious link text alert occured because the link was inserted in a block of text and does not 
            make consistent semantic sense in its context. For example, the link's text ("CLICK FOR MAP") is a standalone sentence and not consistent 
            with the text before or after it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Visual Redesign</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        Based on my findings above, I created a visual design guide for my redesign of the webpage, outlining the logo(s), buttons, color palette and fonts.
        The redesign focuses on simplicity and usability with clear hierarchies indicated by different font colors and font sizes.

      <div>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Mockups</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        I then created mockups for three different screen sizes/types.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="subTitle">Laptop:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For larger screens, I will be using flex layout and the text font sizes will be 14px for body, 14px for buttons and 36px for title. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The flex direction for the image and the text body will “row”.
          </li> 
          <li>
            The flex direction for the buttons in the same row will be “row”, which will be the same for all screen sizes. The flex direction for the paragraphs in the body will be “column”, which will also be the same across all screen sizes. 
          </li>  
          <li>
            The buttons text will change color when being hovered over. 
          </li>  
          <li>
            The horizontal line spacing will be larger for larger screens like a desktop. The accessibility icon and the image of the cat will be larger.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img id="desktopRedesign" src="assets/desktop_redesign.png" alt="Desktop Redesign Mockup">
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="subTitle">Tablet:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For medium-sized screens like an iPad, I will be using flex layout for the buttons and flex layout with flex direction ”column” to position the image and the text body. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The text font sizes will be smaller than those for desktops (12px for body and buttons and 32px for title. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The buttons text will change color when being hovered over. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The line spacing will be the same as a Desktop vertically but smaller than a Desktop horizontally. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The image of the cat will be smaller than that for desktops. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The accessibility icon will be larger than for phone but smaller than for desktop. 
          </li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="subTitle">Phone:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For smaller screens, I will be using flex layout for the buttons and also flex layout with flex direction “column” to position the image and the text body. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The text font sizes will be smaller (10px for body, 10px for buttons and 24px for title). 
          </li>
          <li>
            The buttons will change color when being hovered over. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The horizontal line spacing will be smaller than a desktop and a tablet horizontally and the same as desktop and tablet vertically. 
          </li>
          <li>  
            The accessibility icon will be smaller.
          </li>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="sectionTitle">Redesign</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      The responsive webpage is as follows. It enhanced the original webpage with some 
      new features: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lays out the buttons horizontally to make them more readable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adds underlining to the buttons and adds separation between them to 
          to make them look clickable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Removes redundant clickable links in the text body.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emphasizes more important feature buttons by making them bold and in a different color.
        </li>
        <li>
          Puts a dimmer color on the less important buttons and places them in the upper right corner, which is a less important location.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes the phone number button text into "Call Us" and the location button text into "Google Map" 
          to make their functionalities clearer to the users. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Enlarges the cat photo and places them side by side or above the text body to indicate 
          that the main purpose of this webpage is to introduce a vet for cats.
        </li>
        <li>
          The skipped heading level is fixed. All buttons are of the same size, with the more frequently used buttons being bolded.
        </li>
        <li>
          The suspicious link text is removed because it is redundant information, presenting the same info as some of the buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "Redundant alternative text", "Orphaned form label", "Tabindex", "Noscript element" are fixed because their corresponding elements are removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The color contrast problems are fixed. WebAIM WAIVE shows almost no color contrast errors, except for the red text in the body. 
          However, I decided to keep it because the red color makes the text stand out the most. I thought about removing the highlighting 
          and emphasis because the welcome messages are not really useful information. But I then realized that this is the messages the vet 
          wants to convey the most. So I do not agree with WebAIM WAIVE about the contrast error. All the colors it indicates as enough color contrast 
          are dim.
